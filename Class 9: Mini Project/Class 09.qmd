Here we will analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a csv file from their Github repository.

##data import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.txt", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```


>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


##what is your favorite candy?

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

Twix

```{r}
candy["Twix",]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```
>Q. what is the least liked 

```{r}
x<- c(5, 3, 4, 1)
sort(x)

```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <-order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```


```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```
>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

the winpercent has drastically different numbers

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?


>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks = 10
     )
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

no its skewed to the right

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

below


>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First find all chocolate candy and their $winpercent values

```{r}
choc.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.win<- candy[choc.inds,]$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```



```{r}
fruity.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```
chocolate would be higher 


>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win,fruity.win)
```
yes, small p-value so the difference is statistically significant

##Overall candy rankings

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```




>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE), ], n = 5)
```


>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,rownames(candy))+geom_col()
```

>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+geom_col()+
  labs(x="Win Percent",y=NULL)

ggsave('barplot1.png', width=7, height=10)
```
![](barplot1.png)

can insert images using this markdown

![]
add color. we need to make a custom color vector

```{r}
#start with all black
my_cols <-rep("black",nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+geom_col(fill=my_cols)+
  labs(x="Win Percent",y=NULL)
```


>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets


> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starbursts

##Take a look at pricepercent

```{r}
head(candy$pricepercent)
```
If we want to see what is a good candy to buy in terms of winpercents and pricepercents we can plot these two variables and then see the best candy for the least amount of money.

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=rownames(candy))+ geom_point(col=my_cols)+geom_text()
```
To avoid the overlap of all these labesls we can use an add package called ggrepel
```{r}
#install.packages("ggrepel")
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=rownames(candy))+ geom_point(col=my_cols)+geom_text_repel()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+aes(winpercent,pricepercent, label=rownames(candy))+ geom_point(col=my_cols)+geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 5,col=my_cols)
```


>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

reeses miniatures

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE), ], n = 5)
```
Nik L Nip


##5 Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```



>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Fruity and chocolate


>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?


##6. Principal Component Analysis

The main function is "Prcomp()' and here we kniw we need to scale our data.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

Plot my main PCA score plote with ggplot
```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 9)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

##Loadings plot

```{r}
loadings<-as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings)+aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1))+geom_col()
```
