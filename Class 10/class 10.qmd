##The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures- the PDB

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.

```{r}
pdbstats<-read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in then this causes issues. lets see:
```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
We found a function called 'gsub()' now we can figure out how it works

```{r}
x<-"22,00"
(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
```


```{r}
commasum<-function(x){sum((as.numeric(gsub(",","",x))))}
commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

apply across all columns

```{r}
totals<-apply(pdbstats,2,commasum)

```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

93.26%

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


```{r}
nums<-function(x){(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))}
numbers<-apply(pdbstats,2,nums)
```


```{r}
(numbers[1, "Total"]/ sum(numbers[,"Total"])*100)

```

##2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

We will learn the basics of Mol*(mol-star) homepage: https://molstar.org/viewer/

We wil play with PDB code 1HSG

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor](1HSG.png)

show the ASP 25 amino acids:

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor showing the two important asp 25 amino acids](1HSG 2.png)

## Back to R and working with PDB structures
Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an important protein:)

```{r}
library(bio3d)
hiv<-read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

here we will do a normal mode analysis (nma) to predict functional motions

```{r}
adk<-read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes<-nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

then I can open this file in Mol*
