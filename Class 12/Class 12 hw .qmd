##Section 4: Population Scale Analysis

How many samples do we have?
```{r}
expr<-read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

>Q13:How many of each genotype?
```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

>Q.14:Lets make a boxplot

```{r}
ggplot(expr)+aes(x=geno,y=exp, fill=geno)+
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

>q14. cont:what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

A/A resulted in higher expression and G/G had lower expression. This tells us that this SNP does effect the expression of ORMDL3.
